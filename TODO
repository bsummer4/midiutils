* Libraries
** TODO Many identifiers are too long
   They force many lines to be longer than 80 characters.

** Interfaces are too compilcated
   Try to make the interface much simpler.

* Utillities
  - I want to be able to do this:
        mtick 80 | mmet | msynth >/dev/dsp

** TODO mtick
   - Generate realtime messages for "timing clock" and "Active Sensing" at
     regular intervals.
   - Accept tempo-change messages from a fifo.
   - Optionally, interleve realtime messages with stdin, otherwise close
     stdin immediatly.

*** Process for handling configuration fifos
    - Share the tempo variable with POSIX shm
    - Fork
    - Open the fifo and logfile as fds 0, 1
    - When we get a valid configuration change message, modify the
      configuration variable.

** TODO mmet
   - Generate a snare-drum hit every quarter-note (every 24 "timing clock"
     messages).
   - Various time/signatures - Time/signatures settable through fifo
   like in "ticks"

** TODO msynth
   - A very simple synthesiser.  - Drums are played as clicks and pops.
   - Notes are all just sine waves.
