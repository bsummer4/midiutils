* Libraries
** TODO 'midifile' is still a complete mess.
** TODO 'midimsg' is pretty good but needs documentation.
* Utillities
  - I want to be able to do this:

        mtick 80 | mmet | msynth >/dev/dsp

** TODO mmet
   - Various time/signatures

** TODO msynth
   - Percussion as white-noise

** TODO mclips
   - A sample-playback system.
   - Sound files are loaded/unloaded using a command language.
   - Files come with a bit of metadata:
     - Tempo
     - Pitch
     - Program
     - Bank

   - MIDI On starts playback of the note corresponding to the bank/program.
   - MIDI Off stops playback.
   - The 'rubberband' library is used to do pitch shifting and time stretching.
   - This can be used as a sample-playback system but is meant to be used
     more allong the lines of a DAW.

** TODO mfrags
   - Uses the exact same interfaces as mclips but uses midifiles instead
     of sound files.

** TODO Midi file Playback System
   - Jumpping around
   - Stop/start
   - Loops
   - Doesn't leave notes ringing after skip/stop!
   - Tempo changes
   - Polls for changes to the midifile.

** TODO Midi sequencer
   - Constantly polls for changes to the directory.
   - Data is a set of type-0 midi files in a directory.
   - The file 'seq' is the top-level sequencer file that controls when
     the other tracks are played.
   - Files '1' through '128' are midi snippets that correspond to
     instruments in seq.
   - Convert back-and-forth between type-1 and this directory structure
   - tgz!
